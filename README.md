# ScreenshotApiDownloadServer
Server side API to get website screenshots easily deployed and expanded download server allowing multiple download servers to exist while only one main server exists.


Quick Note:
  On install you must use yarn and not npm, there seems to be a bug with the npm install of puppeteer meaning that chromium will not be intalled
